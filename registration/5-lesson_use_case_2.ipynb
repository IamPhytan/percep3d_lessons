    "% Describe the application\n",
    "In collaboration with \\acx{air}, prototypes were developed for the inspection and maintenance of industrial plants.\n",
    "Some inspection tasks need to move inspection tools in environments that are difficult to access by human due to dimensional, temperature or air quality constraints.\n",
    "The use of mobile systems for inspection can not only deal with those constraints, but also can reduce the time and costs of inspections.\n",
    "This would, for example, allow for the inspection of critical pieces of equipment on location, without the need to dismantle any structures. Similarly, the installation of scaffolding around a structure becomes unnecessary, thus saving inspection time.\n",
    "The typical environments encountered during inspection procedures are confined spaces (indoors) with well structured, static surfaces.\n",

    "% Describe the platform\n",
    "For the specific task of steam chest inspection, a robot was developed with high mobility capabilities and a compact size \\citep{Tache:2009uy}.\n",
    "The robot, named Magnebike, moved around a metallic, cylindric environment by using its two magnetic wheels positioned in the same configuration as a bike (\\autoref{fig:robotMagnebike}).\n",
    "Those specialized wheels coupled with small lever arms allowed the platform to move up-side-down, pass 90$^\\circ$ edges and navigate in high curvature tube.\n",
    "A considerable amount of effort were invested in reducing the size of the platform, which ultimately gave a small volume of 0.006\\,m$^3$ and a weight of 0.34\\,kg.\n",
    "The platform was the slowest presented in this section, with a maximal velocity value of only 0.045 m/s.\n",
    "The robot gathered high-resolution scans (340,000 points) with a refresh time of 50\\,s.\n",
    "The 3D scans were assembled from a 2D Hokuyo URG-04LX.\n",
    "Pre-alignment of the scans were ensured by wheel odometry, which displays virtually no slip because of the magnetic force hold the wheels on the surfaces.\n",
    "An \\acx{imu} was used in conjunction with the odometry to cope with the 3D nature of the motion \\citep{Tache:2011ef}.\n",
    "The main sources of pre-alignment errors were: (1) motions perpendicular to the gravity vector that were not observable with the sensor used, and (2) the rapid cumulation of errors by the low-cost \\acx{imu} used on the slow-moving robot.\n",
    "\n",
    "%--------------------------------------------------\n",
    "%\\subsection{Steam Chest Reconstruction}\n",
    "% Describe the solution\n",
    "During inspection, the robot is intended to be tethered for safety reason, which solved the communication problem between the embedded computer and a faster system used as control station.\n",
    "Because the system must not damage the inspected structure in any case, it traveled slowly in the environment, reducing the pressure on the real-time requirement for the registration.\n",
    "However, the operator might not have a visual contact with the robot at all times during inspection.\n",
    "Therefore, the map resolution must be high enough to detect obstacles and holes during remote operations.\n",
    "The number of points produced by the scanner was significantly larger than strictly necessary for a proper registration.\n",
    "To reduce rapidly this number of points, we randomly removed 90\\,\\% of the point as soon as the scan were recorded.\n",
    "We used a maximal density of 20000 points per m$^3$ to cope with the small size of inspected environments.\n",
    "For the registration, we did not use any pre-alignment to test the worst case scenario (i.e., when the rotation is not observable by the \\acx{imu}).\n",
    "This forced us to extend the maximal matching distance to 0.5\\,m, even if a scan was taken roughly at every 0.30\\,m.\n",
    "Given that scans are taken by an operator at a fix and short interval, we used an outlier ratio of 80\\,\\%.\n",
