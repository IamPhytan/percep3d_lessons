    "This step relies on the definition of an error metric calculated from the association of features and needs to be resolved using an error model.\n",
    "The error model can be sometimes the same as the distance metric used at the matching stage but the main difference is that error is only defined in the feature space and not in the descriptor space.\n",
    "This is because only features are influenced by transformation parameters, as listed in \\autoref{tab:influenceFunc}.\n",
    "So, if the association is based on descriptor distances, another error must be defined to correct the misalignment.\n",
    "Parameters selected for the minimization should follow an expected deformation model. \n",
    "\\citet{Zitova:2003hq} present two generic types to classify error metrics: global (rigid, affine transform, perspective projection model) and local (radial basis functions, elastic registration, fluid registration, diffusion-based, level sets, optical-flow-based registration).\n",

    "Point-to-point error uses the most basic primitive and was first introduced in a registration context by \\citet{Besl:1992iv} and used subsequently in multiple solutions \\citep{Godin:1994uh,Pulli:1999hya,Druon:2006im,YePan:2010ip,Kim:2010fe}.\n",
    "During the matching step, it might happen that different kind of geometric primitives (e.g., point, line, curve, plane, quadric) are matched together.\n",
    "Multiple error metrics were developed for those situations and we want to bring them under the same concept that we introduce as \\emph{Shape Morphing}.\n",
    "Essentially, when a primitive with higher dimensionality is matched with a lower one, it is morphed via projective geometry to adapt to its counterpart.\n",
    "\\autoref{fig:shapeMorph} presents the list of possible combination for a 2D space and illustrates the concept for different errors. Using the subfigure labeled point-to-line as an example, a point in solid red matches a line in dashed blue.\n",
    "To generate an alignment error, a virtual point (i.e., the empty blue circle) is generated by projection. \n",
    "The same principle applies to point-to-curve and line-to-curve.\n",

    "Its 2D version, point-to-line, is also used in robotics \\citep{Bosse:2009kn} and a closed-form solution was presented by \\citet{Censi:2008va}.\n",
    "Using higher complexity to represent 3D primitives, \\citet{Segal:2009ws} propose the use of plane-to-plane, while early work of \\citet{Feldmar:1996cc} uses quadric-to-quadric.\n",
