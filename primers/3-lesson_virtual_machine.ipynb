    "The practical part of this course involves working with the Robot Operating System (ROS) running on top of the Linux distribution Ubuntu.\n",
    "The exercises expect you to have your own instance of the system to experiment with.\n",
    "There are several possibilities on how to proceed:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "1. __You have your Windows or Mac installation and no Linux will ever touch your hard drive__\n",
    "\n",
    "   This is actually the most probable scenario.\n",
    "   We have prepared an image of a virtual machine with Ubuntu and ROS already installed and set.\n",
    "   There is a price to pay in performance since the virtualized system cannot run as fast as a real one, yet it will allow you to do all the exercises.\n",
    "   Follow the [instructions from here](#Virtual-machine-download-and-installation).\n",
    "   \n",
    "1. __You already have a PC with a Ubuntu 18.04 installed on it__\n",
    "   \n",
    "   Great, we will help you install the ROS and some software necessary for the course and you are good to go.\n",
    "   You can start by installing a [ROS Melodic](http://wiki.ros.org/melodic/Installation/Ubuntu), you want the _Desktop Install_ configuration which contains all we need for the course.\n",
    "   We will support this installation in person.\n",
    "   Just ask an instructor on Slack for help.\n",
    "   \n",
    "1. __You have a PC with Linux (Ubuntu or not)__\n",
    "\n",
    "   This is for people with a Linux distribution other than Ubuntu or for those who have Ubuntu but still prefer using a virtual machine.\n",
    "   If you are in this situation, you can use the virtual machine we prepared for you.\n",
    "   You might encounter an issue with the `vmmon` kernel module, when launching the virtual machine using VMWare.\n",
    "   To fix the issue, follow the steps described [here](https://askubuntu.com/questions/1096052/vmware-15-error-on-ubuntu-18-4-could-not-open-dev-vmmon-no-such-file-or-dire#1145426).\n",
    "   Then, follow the [instructions from here](#Virtual-machine-download-and-installation).\n",
    "   \n",
    "1. __You have a spare PC or you are willing to setup a dual-boot configuration on your PC__\n",
    "\n",
    "   Then, consider installing Ubuntu 18.04 on it. When you are done, GOTO (2.)"
