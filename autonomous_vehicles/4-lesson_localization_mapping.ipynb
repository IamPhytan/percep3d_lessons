    "# The problem of SLAM\n",
    "\n",
    "This acronym is very important for autonomous vehicles and it stands for Simultaneous Localization and Mapping.\n",
    "As a short explanation, the main problem that SLAM tried to solve is twofold.\n",
    "On one side, if you have a perfect 3D map of the environment, it is easy to localize in that environment using you sensors.\n",
    "On the other side, if you know perfectly where is your vehicle is at all times, you just need to stitch you sensor information to construct a map of the environment.\n",
    "Now, if you don't have either, which is most of the case when you're exploring a new environment, you need to localize and map your environment at the same time.\n",
    "These actions are achieved using three steps:\n",
    "1. **prediction**: given your physical model of the vehicle and your current state (i.e., position, velocity, and acceleration), you try to predict where the vehicle will be at the time interval.\n",
    "1. **measurement**: after the time interval as passed, you estimate where the vehicle is.\n",
    "1. **update**: you minimize the error from your prediction and your measurement.\n",
    "\n",
    "Key challenges related to SLAM are:\n",
    "- State estimation / state fusion\n",
    "- Map representations;\n",
    "- Loop detection / alignment error recovery; and\n",
    "- Data management;\n",
    "\n",
    "with the two first points being related to 3D registration algorithms.\n",
    "We will see in detail what are those registration algorithms during this lecture, but at this stage, you only need to know that it is an algorithm that allows you to minimize the alignment error between two representation of the environment.\n",
    "For example, in the following video, a registration algorithm was used to align the cube in red with the cube in gray through an iterative process:"

    "# General state estimation solutions\n",
    "\n",
    "It is rather important to be able to estimate the state of an autonomous vehicle related to its location (pose, velocity, and acceleration).\n",
    "After all, most of the tasks expected from a vehicle are to move from a point A to a point B.\n",
    "It would take a full lecture to cover all the aspects of 3D state estimation properly, but it's not the goal of this lesson to get close to that.\n",
    "The good thing is that most of the 3D machinery explain in the theory part of this lecture are necessary to understand state estimation.\n",
    "In this section, my goal is simply to quickly present the three types of solutions, which are\n",
    "1. filter\n",
    "1. window\n",
    "1. global\n",
    "\n",
    "We will explain those types of solution graphically instead of mathematically.\n",
    "The trajectory of a vehicle is often depicted as the following figure.\n",
    "Triangles is a conceptual representation of the state of the vehicle.\n",
    "You can think as those triangles showing the position and orientation of the vehicle at that time, but you need to recall that states may include velocity and acceleration.\n",
    "Then, there are links between those states, which put constraints on how one state transforms to another one.\n",
    "For example, if you want to know the linear position of a car and you only have access to the acceleration of that car, the triangle (the state) would represent the distance from a starting position and the link between states would be acceleration and time.\n",

    "</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "The first type of solutions, _filter_, will only use the last state to predict where the vehicle will be.\n",
    "Then, sensors will produce a measurement and both the prediction and the measurement will be fused to produce the final estimate.\n",
    "What is not depicted in the following figure showing this process is that both the prediction and the measurement have uncertainty and the resulting estimate is expected to have a lower uncertainty.\n",
    "The key point to recall here is that, once the estimate is produced, it is fixed and will never change.\n",

    "The second type of solution, _window_, does almost the same thing, but the optimization will adjust a group of states instead of only the current state.\n",
    "The term window comes from the standard way to define the active state is by using a time window around the current time.\n",
    "For example, you could parametrize your algorithm to optimize all states from the last 10 seconds.\n",
    "The following figure illustrates that using an example with fours states being active.\n",

    "Finally, if you push the idea to its limit, we get the global solution where all the states are active.\n",
    "This is typically useful when new information can modify all states.\n",
    "This situation happen when a vehicle that was cumulating localization error and return to a known location.\n",
    "We say that there is a loop closure at this moment, which is another constraint in the optimization process saying, for example, that there should not be more than two meter distance between the starting and ending pose.\n",
    "When that detection happen, the error must be backpropagated through all the states to achieve a better estimate, as depicted in the next figure.\n",

    "Now, sensors such as wheel odometry, accelerometers, and gyroscopes give you directly a partial measurement of the state of a vehicle, but not a lidar or a camera.\n",
    "This is where registration algorithms become handy as they measure the displacement between two states by minimizing the alignment error.\n",
    "In other words, registration algorithms are one tool to add a line between triangles in our drawings of state estimation solutions."
