    "Lidars are one of the most common sensors one can find on autonomous vehicles. The reason behind their popularity is that they are becoming more and more affordable and provide rich 3D information about the geometry of the surroundings. In this lesson, you will learn the basics of how lidars work and what are their limitations. "
