    "# Basic principle\n",
    "\n",
    "## In one dimension\n",
    "First of all, what is a lidar?\n",
    "Well, a 1D lidar would be a [laser rangefinder](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laser_rangefinder), you know, those small devices used to measure a distance.\n",
    "They send a laser pulse on an object and measure how much time it takes for the pulse to bounce on it and come back.\n",
    "Knowing this time and the speed at which the pulse travels (the speed of light), one can compute the distance between the lidar and the object.\n",
    "\n",
    "<p style=\"text-align: center;\">\n",
    "<img src=\"images/1d_lidar.svg\" width=\"50%\">\n",
    "</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "## In two dimensions\n",
    "If you take this laser and point it to a mirror rotating along the Z axis, you can _scan_ a line around the sensor, meaning you now have a 2D lidar.\n",
    "The output of such a lidar is no longer a single distance (or point), but a set of points (i.e. a point cloud) in 2D.\n",
    "The position of a point is computed using the time it takes for a laser pulse to bounce back to the lidar as well as the mirror angle at the moment at which the pulse was fired.\n",
    "This will give you an angle and a distance (i.e. [polar coordinates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polar_coordinate_system)), which can then be converted to [2D Cartesian coordinates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cartesian_coordinate_system#Cartesian_coordinates_in_two_dimensions) (in the frame of the lidar).\n",
    "\n",
    "<p style=\"text-align: center;\">\n",
    "<img src=\"images/2d_lidar.gif\" width=\"15%\">\n",
    "</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "## In three dimensions\n",
    "Finally, if you take multiple lasers (or channels or beams) and point them to the good old rotating mirror, you can _scan_ multiple lines (at different heights) around the sensor, which means you now have a 3D lidar.\n",
    "The following image shows the output of such a lidar.\n",
    "If you look carefully at the layout of the points, you will be able to see the scan lines (or rings) of the different lasers around the lidar.\n",
    "When computing the position of a point in 3D, the difference with 2D is that positions are computed using two angles: the vertical angle (i.e. channel angle) as well as the horizontal/azimuth angle (i.e. mirror angle).\n",
    "Therefore, you will have two angles and one distance (i.e. [spherical coordinates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spherical_coordinate_system)), which can then be converted to [3D Cartesian coordinates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cartesian_coordinate_system#Cartesian_coordinates_in_three_dimensions) (in the frame of the lidar).\n",
