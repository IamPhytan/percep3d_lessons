    "The idea of the _rosbag_ package is to save this data stream on a hard drive as a file.\n",
    "Given that time of reception of each message is saved as well, we end up having a tool to replay the state of the ROS system anytime in the future (without actually needing the robot).\n",

    "In robotics, we often perform tests and experiments with real robots but sometimes our code does not work as expected in the field.\n",
    "The ability to save all sensor data in a compact way and replay it later helps us to effectively manage our work with robots. During a session with real hardware, we can focus on the experiment and later, we can take all time we need to design and debug our software.\n",
    "Of course, software with robot-controlling functions cannot be fully tested with recorded sensor data, there are real experiments or simulators for this purpose.\n",
    "Yet having a stable perception part of the software already when focusing on the control software is a strong advantage in the field."

    "More in detail, [wiki.ros.org/rosbag/Commandline](http://wiki.ros.org/rosbag/Commandline) lists all the possible commands you can call from a terminal.\n",

    "There are some parameters such as playback speed, starting time, playback length, etc., that you can find about by running `rosbag play -h`.\n",
    "Moreover, you can pause the playback by pressing the space key.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you recall the [lesson on Rviz](2-lesson-ros-rviz.ipynb), we were executing an additional command before the _rosbag play_ which also had an additional parameter: `--clock`.\n",
    "Reason for this is that we recorded the bagfile in some point in history.\n",
    "All the time information stored in that bagfile is coming from a system clock of a robot that ran on February 26, 2020.\n",
    "As long as we only play a bagfile and observe data in Rviz, `rosbag play` should be sufficient.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, we might want to run some ROS nodes that consume data from the recorded topics and also depend on current time information.\n",
    "Let's imagine a ROS node that subscribes a topic with camera images and inserts a text information to those images with current time and data, same as the old analog cameras did (photo courtesy of [Applied Science](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCivA7_KLKWo43tFcCkFvydw)):\n",

    "Now, your images receive a wrong time stamp, the one for the time of stamping, not for the time of taking the photo.\n",
    "ROS offers a solution for this situation: The `rosbag play --clock` option causes the rosbag player to publish a new topic called _clock_ which informs all running nodes in the ROS system about correct _\"current time\"_, the time of the bagfile.\n",
    "There is one more requirement though.\n",
    "Before running any nodes or the rosbag player, a parameter in ROS needs to be set that tells all the nodes that there will be such _clock_ topic they should listen to. \n",
    "This parameter is set by calling `rosparam set use_sim_time true`.\n",
    "We prefer to use this _simulated_ time method since it helps us avoid unpredicted behavior of our software when re-playing bagfiles.\n",
    "To recap how to play bagfiles with the _clock_ option on:\n",
    "1. Run a `roscore`.\n",
    "2. Execute `rosparam set use_sim_time true`.\n",
    "3. Play your bagfile: `rosbag play --clock my_bagfile.bag`\n",
    "4. As long as the roscore is running, you can repeat step 3. as many times as you wish.\n",
